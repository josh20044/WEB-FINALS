            <p>Who's ready for a special episode of a Heroic Tale? Learn about the origins of the newest VIP Heroic dragon... The High Redemption Norn Dragon! <br>Find her in the current Season of the Divine Pass and enjoy <b>HEROIC TALES | EPISODE #4 - Rise of the Norn.</b></p><br>
            <p>“The Redemption Ring don’t like to draw attention to themselves; they prefer to go about their business under the radar. They are too busy making <br>amends for the atrocities they committed to worry about the Shadows of the Occult or the Eternal Day.</p><br><br>
            <p>The High Redemption Norn Dragon’s story, however, is far more inflammatory than those of her Redemption cousins.</p><br>
            <p>As of today, she’s been freed from her chains of guilt. She did it. She has achieved what no other Redemption dragon has been able to yet. It took huge <br>acts of bravery and years of selfless actions to be considered worthy of a Heroic status. Of course, these acts of selflessness HAD to be mighty, if they <br>intended to counteract her unforgettable sins.</p><br>
            <p>But this does beg the question, what was she guilty of in the first place?</p><br>
            <p>Many years ago, Norn – as she was known before her Arc of Redemption – tended to Yggdrasil, drawing water from her sacred well to ensure this <br>mighty beast and his Tree of Life were always well nourished. The lush Forests of Life occasionally suffered from Corrupted rot, so Norn hydrated the <br>greenery far and wide.</p><br>
            <p>Dragons from all over would come to gaze at powerful Yggdrasil and the emerald green foliage, but who came to give thanks to the one providing them <br>with nutrients? Not a soul. Norn saw visitors come and go without so much of a “thank you” for her hard work.</p><br>
            <p>Jealous of the attention, and tired of her work going unappreciated, Norn's patience had run out. She no longer wanted to be invisible.</p><br>
            <p>By adding just a few drops of the Corrupted Nature Dragon’s toxic nectar to Yggdrasil’s water, Norn changed the course of history. The first to fall was <br>Yggdrasil himself, followed by his Tree of Life, until every Tree in every Forest had absorbed the poison and succumbed to this liquid death, <br>disappearing from the Dragonverse forever. Dragon Masters will know that it took years for Yggdrasil and a single Tree of Life to return to their City; <br>although, because of Norn, the Forests never fully regrew…</p><br>
            <p>Norn didn't mean for her actions to be so catastrophic; she only wanted a bit of recognition, but the deed was done, and the guilt became too much.<br> After turning herself into the Ascended, her Arc of Redemption began.</p><br>
            <p>In modern-day Dragon City, Norn faces a decision. She is now free to do as she wants, but an interesting crossroad of morals has presented itself.</p><br>
            <p>Does she use her new Heroic status for good and form an alliance with the High Master Karma or High Ascended Supreme dragons? Or does she head <br>to the High Corrupted Time Dragon’s lair now she’s got a taste for causing mass disruption?</p><br>
            <p>Maybe you can help her rise to the Ascended Realm with the Risen Skill Skin, or will you bring out the Chaos element within her and let her fall with <br>the Fallen Skill Skin? You decide, Dragon Master!”</p><br>
