        <p>There are many powerful dragons in the Dragonverse, but how many of them have what it takes to become a true champion?
<br>
<br>
            Asking himself the very same question, Deus has decided to hold a brand new event… Welcome to the Deus’ Arena Showdown.
        <hr>
        Arena Showdowns last 1 week, starting every Thursday at 12 PM CEST.
        <br>
        <br>

Battle in the Arenas with boosted elements and without dragon cooldowns, meaning your dragons will never get tired!
<br>
<br>
During each Arena Showdown, five chosen Tributes will have to prove their strength and bravery on the battlefield!

Their damage and life points will be boosted, and their hatching, Empower, and Recall times will be reduced.
