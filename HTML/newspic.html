    <div id="text1"><p id="Tcont1">Over time, the Spikes have gained the respect of some of the most powerful dragon families in the Dragonverse.
<br>
<br>

        Why, you may ask? It’s because when attacked, Spiked dragons will defend hard!
        <br>
<br>
        
        Famous for the razor-sharp spikes that forged their family name, the Spiked dragons certainly aroused the interest of others, especially the Titans! Plenty of them are eager to get a piece of the action and add spikes to their own defensive shields. But for now, the Spiked dragons remain one-of-a-kind with their unique damaging defense strategy.
<br>
<br>
        Meet the Spikes and give their unique skill a go on the battlefield!</div> 
<br>
         
    
        <h3>IMPALING SHELTER SKILL</h3>
This new dragon family possesses a unique skill:<b> Impaling Shelter.</b>
<br>
<br>
Spiked dragons can deploy a spiky<b> shield to protect themselves from an attack while dealing damage</b> to their opponent.
<br>
<br>
The shield remains active until the opponent attacks the Spiked dragon. A portion of the damage that would be inflicted upon the Spiked dragon is<b> reflected back onto the enemy</b> instead.
<br>
<br>
The Impaling Shelter Skill can be activated at any time (not including when the skill has a cooldown) and will remain on the battlefield even if the Spiked dragon is switched out.
<hr>   
<br> 
Remember, there are four (4) Spiked dragons to collect! Reunite all four members of this family during the upcoming months<b> to obtain the 5th Mythical Spiked dragon for FREE!</b>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Don’t forget to update your Dragon City game </b>to the latest version available in your Official App Store so that the Spikes can enter your City and their special Skill Skin to be used.
