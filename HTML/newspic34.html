            <p>What better time than during Pride Month to read a special Episode of Heroic Tales! Meet the new Drag-On Dragon, discover their brave story, and get your ‘drag on’ in Dragon City! 🏳‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧ 👑</p><br>
            <p>” Some dragons are flyers, others are walkers; Some live in a cave, and others underwater. Some dragons have wings, whether big or small; And remember that some might not have any at all! Some dragons are sturdy, others are speedy; Sometimes they are scaley, or maybe even furry! Here in Dragon City, there are no bad surprises; Because we love that dragons come in all shapes and sizes!"</p><br>
            <p>For as long as they could remember, the Drag-On Dragon had always been labeled. They were constantly being shoved into boxes that didn’t quite represent them.</p><br>
            <p>“You’re a Happy dragon, why aren’t you smiling?”; aren’t even Happy dragons allowed their down days?</p><br>
            <p>“You don’t look like a Beauty dragon…”; doesn’t beauty come in many forms?</p><br>
            <p>“You shouldn’t breathe ice flames in front of baby dragons, best stick to good ol’ fire.”; don’t dragons have all types of skills and abilities?</p><br>
            <p>These are just some of the remarks that Drag-On regularly heard growing up. Drag-On never really felt like they fitted in. They often wanted to try new elemental fighting techniques, train new attacks, and try on different battle outfits; but if these didn’t fit with the norm, Drag-On was laughed at and shunned.</p><br>
            <p>Seeing how Drag-On was being held back, a group of noble Heroic dragons bravely stood up for Drag-On and supported them in becoming who they wanted to be.</p><br>
            <p>Having also faced their own personal battles against prejudices, High Commander, High Queen, and High Positivity, rallied together to spread this important message of diversity and inclusion.</p><br>
            <p>With the support of others, Drag-On was finally able to embark on their path of self-discovery! They played dress-up with the iconic Avant-Garde Dragon, they honed their Happy attacks with the High Cinco Dragon, and they grew more confident in themselves every day.</p><br>
            <p>Years later, now stronger, wiser, and prouder than ever before, Drag-On also became an important figure for other dragons, as well as for Nox, whom they could look up to for guidance and support – Dragon City has become a place of love and kindness thanks to Drag-On’s brave steps towards free expression.</p><br>
            <p>So no matter who you choose to be, how you feel inside or out, and who you want to love, there’ll always be a place alongside Drag-On in Dragon City for you.</p><br>
            <p>You can meet them in your game during the Pride 2023 event.</p><br>
