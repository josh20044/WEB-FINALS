            This is the moment lots of our Dragon Masters have been waiting for…
            <br>
            <br>
            Are you ready to use your imagination and awesome writing skills to create a new Dragon City story?
            <br>
            <br>
            This time, the story is in your hands! But how?
            <br>
            <br>
            Participate in the new <b>Dragon City’s Storytelling Challenge</b> and write your own tale using <b>any of the currently available in-game dragons,</b> for a chance to have your very own story be part of the Dragon City universe and receive other in-game rewards.

            <br>    
            <b>There are a few rules you need to follow to participate in the Challenge</b>:
            <br>
            <br>
            The Story must be about <b>one or more already existing Dragon City’s Dragons;</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Dragons tied to a third-party promotion (for example, Influencers, YouTubers, or The Walking Dead) won’t be taken into account;
            <br>
            <br>
            Your Submission <b>must be written in English…</b> But don’t worry, your level of English and your writing skills will not be taken into account; our Writers will give your story the final magical touch to make it perfect;
            <br>
            <br>
            The most important thing is for you to make your Story <b>original and exciting,</b> and to <b>make sure it connects well with the Dragon City universe;</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Submission must be <b>no more than five hundred (500) words in length.</b> In addition, it is recommended that the Submission is <b>at least one hundred and fifty (150) words in length;</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Once your Story is ready, submit it in a <b>PDF</b> or <b>Microsoft Word</b> readable file format and send it to our email: community.competition@socialpoint.es;
            <br>
            <br>
            It is very important to include your in-game User ID together with your submission (How do you find your User ID? Check this!);
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Don’t use any Artificial Intelligence</b> (“AI”) tools to create your Story!
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>

            You have <b>3 weeks</b> to write and submit your Story to our email: the Storytelling Challenge begins at <b>12:00:01 PM CEST on 23 October 2023</b> and <b>ends at 11:59:59 AM CET on 13 November 2023.</b>

            Once we have received and reviewed all of your Submissions, we will select the 3 winning stories and reward the participants as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            The First Winner will receive <b>three hundred (300) Gems;</b> additionally, their Story will be reviewed and readjusted by our Writers to feature in a new Episode of our beloved Heroic Tales;
            <br>
            <br>
            The Second Winner will receive <b>one hundred and fifty (150) Gems;</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            The Third Winner will receive <B>seventy-five (75) Gems.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Before participating in the Storytelling Challenge, make sure you are familiar with the full T&Cs – available HERE!,</b>
            <br>
